project_one=Project.create(title: "Plan a Garden", description: "This is an application designed to help users imagine the kind of garden that they would like to create and then start to plan it. The idea for it came from the avid gardening I did last summer and from my appreciation of the community gardens all over New York City." , video: "PlanAGardenVideo", image: "./Images/Azaleas.jpg")
project_two=Project.create(title: "Book and Movie Memory Bank", description: "The Book and Movie Memory Bank was inspired by some of my experiences planning courses when I was a Philosophy instructor and writing essays as a student. Occasionally, I would end up mining my memory when deciding what to teach, trying to remember the name of a film I saw years ago that would be especially relevant for a particular class. Or, as I was writing I would be reminded of an idea from an essay or book and would rack my brain or have to rummage through my notes trying to find the title of it. The Book and Movie Memory Log is a place to store information about films or books that have made an impact on you, that you know you want to remember and may want to return to for various purposes later on." , video: "BookandMovieMemoryBankVideo", image: "./Images/Book_and_Movie_Memory_Bank.jpg")
project_three=Project.create(title:  "National Park Trip Planner", description: "National Parks Trip Planner provides information about national parks in the United States, fetching from the National Park Service API and also linking to the National Park Service website. Users can save parks that they would like to go to or learn more about and take notes on saved parks as they plan a trip. The idea for this application came from my eagerness to get outdoors. I like that National Parks are low-cost and offer educational opportunities about both history and nature.", video: "NationalParksDemo", image: "./Images/United_States.jpg")
