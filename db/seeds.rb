"While working on my final project for Access Labs, I have been learning how to use localStorage so that users can navigate away from an app when they click on an external link and then return without having to log back in or refresh the page. This blog post is about what I have learned so far, particularly about storage that is not as permanent as saving something to the database but not as fleeting as saving something to state and not persisting it. It is a middle ground for keeping things around when you go away for a short while and want them to still be there when you come back. And if you never log out they may stay there for longer than you imagined they would. \n In the last module, we worked on saving the token and user id to localStorage, but I wanted to practice adding more to it. I started with the username, because my greeting to the user was turning into this after they navigated away from the app and returned to it, until I put it in localStorage")
